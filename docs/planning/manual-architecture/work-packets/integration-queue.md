# Integration queue

Specification version: 1. Manual planning record; not a runtime allocation or permission to execute. Read [common packet rules](../packet-rules.md), which are part of this record.

## Outcome and milestone

Purpose: Integrate approved revisions in project FIFO order.

Project outcomes: [EXE-PM2 — Integrate work and deliver declared dependencies](https://github.com/jmiedreich-ux/Maestro/blob/182bf4290ef2960d4691a7f41315ebf71d5bf85c/docs/milestones/execution-milestones.md#exe-pm2--integrate-work-and-deliver-declared-dependencies).

Development milestone: [Integrated code and dependency delivery](../development-milestones.md#integrated-code-and-dependency-delivery). This packet contributes to those outcomes; it does not alone complete their declarations.

## Starting context

Source commit: `182bf4290ef2960d4691a7f41315ebf71d5bf85c`; later assigned base includes exact integrated prerequisite commits under [baseline rules](../packet-rules.md#starting-context-and-delivery-baseline). Read [investigation](../investigation.md#code-direction-findings), [structure](../project-structure.md), [specialist role](../../../../services/maestro/maestro/execution/.maestro/role-execution-coordination.md) and [starting context](../../../../services/maestro/maestro/execution/.maestro/context.md).

Controlling behavior: [integration management and queue](../../../architecture.md#integration-management-and-queue).

## Included scope and interfaces

Persistent Integration Manager and durable queue; target milestone branch, exact inputs, bounded conflict/code changes and independent change review.

Provider contract: Queue transaction reserves one operation; Git journal and stage recovery reconcile unknown merge/push outcome.

Consumer connection: Dependency import consumes integrated provider head; promotion waits for assembled gates, not queue completion alone.

## Exclusions and stop boundary

Do not implement the work of another packet, change accepted product behavior, delete old modules/data, alter unlisted files or use test results as independent approval. Common exclusions and authority boundaries apply. Stop affected work for a missing prerequisite, schema/behavior conflict, unavailable required resource or unsafe operation; return the concrete issue through the assigned process. Technical failure does not authorize changing scope or resetting a budget.

## Dependencies and safe parallel work

- [Independent packet review](packet-review.md): its listed provider contract must be integrated at an exact recorded commit before this packet uses it.
- [Publication journal](publication.md): its listed provider contract must be integrated at an exact recorded commit before this packet uses it.

Independent packets may run in parallel once their own prerequisites hold and their allocated files/resources do not overlap. Do not edit provider files to make a missing contract appear available. [Shared ownership and migration rules](../packet-rules.md#exact-permitted-outputs-and-ownership) apply; all later Execution stages implement lifecycle and recovery integration from first delivery.

## Permitted paths and required outputs

No other repository write is permitted by this record.

| Exact path | Format | Required result |
|---|---|---|
| `services/maestro/maestro/execution/integration.py` | Python | Assigned behavior and integration contract |
| `services/maestro/maestro/execution/queue.py` | Python | Assigned behavior and integration contract |
| `tests/maestro/execution/test_integration_queue.py` | Python | Real main-path and essential-failure checks |

Non-JSON deliverables use schema reference null. JSON process schemas implement the named architecture definitions and installation mapping, not a private alternate format. No optional hidden output or broad directory permission is inferred.

## Execution requirements

```json
{
  "required_capabilities": [
    "code_edit",
    "local_command",
    "repository_search",
    "approved_network"
  ],
  "allowed_locations": [
    "local_ai_box",
    "cloud"
  ],
  "minimum_context_tokens": 32768
}
```

Actual installed route/model, permissions, credentials and workspace identity are collected and checked by the service at assignment; none is selected here. A network capability still requires explicit permitted destinations. Any host-specific integration check uses the approved Linux test environment; a cloud coding route does not substitute a different product platform.

## Completion criteria

1. Persistent Integration Manager takes project FIFO head, verifies approved source and target milestone branch, integrates then journals exact remote result.
2. Blocked head holds later entries; conflict code change receives separate independent review; no unreviewed fix or stale target passes.
3. The included provider/consumer responsibilities use the real module/service boundary and meaningful declared outputs, with no unsupported stub or silent fallback. A provider demonstrates its boundary with a real minimal caller; later consumer implementation and assembled acceptance follow the common integration rules.
4. Mandatory checks below produce actual passing evidence for included behavior; disclose missing evidence as UNTESTED. Submit the exact scoped result for independent review under the common completion rules.

## Verification and essential failures

Preparation: isolated Python environment at the assigned base; `PYTHONPATH=services/maestro` for source-tree checks. Installed/external resources must come from the approved setup; do not install/provision or broaden access implicitly.

Exact test command:

```json
["python","-m","unittest","discover","-s","tests/maestro/execution","-p","test_integration_queue.py","-v"]
```

Required assertions: completion criteria 1 and 2, plus this essential rejection/recovery boundary: Blocked FIFO head holds later entries; unresolved conflict and unreviewed integration edit cannot merge.

The test file must observe the real included capability. Low-level deterministic inputs may isolate component logic; any actual service/agent/Git path promised by these criteria requires real path evidence, not a fake result. Missing installed resources are recorded as UNTESTED with nonzero status; do not convert them into success using a skip. Capture actual inputs, expected/observed results, command/exit output and source revision. No tests were run when writing this specification.

## Handoff

Return the saved implementation plan, exact base/local head, changed-path list, checks and their observed results, evidence references, limitations and unresolved work to the Development Manager. Service wrapper/remote verification and a non-author review follow. This file grants no integration, promotion, Owner confirmation or Execution-start authority.
