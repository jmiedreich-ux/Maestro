# Maestro — Current Project Handoff

**Date:** 2026-09-03
**State:** review-readiness gate merged; risk-based review disposition adopted; next implementation slice not selected

Read [Maestro Development Status and Process-Delay Record](../../docs/planning/maestro-development-status.md)
before taking any Maestro action. It is the current status ledger and records
the process failures, interim controls, exact branch heads, and safe resume
sequence. Then read
[the current source handoff](../../sources/planning/current-handoff.md), the
Master Plan, the relevant decisions, the active packet, and the actual Git
worktree state.

## Integrated state

Alpha-01 through Alpha-03 are complete on master. The master baseline before
this status update was `8aa4cb517dcb902060cf5acd1d58806787e03841`.
Alpha-03's official accepted implementation remains
`f21e4a2ff25cead8b972b4433da33f0e9910efc5`, with its explicit
trusted-fixture limitation.

No M1 implementation is merged to master.

## Unmerged M1 evidence

- Planning branch: `architecture/m1-m4-packets`
- Committed planning head: `ab271ffea42204c44c1894d53ba10e0d5f34ca4f`
- Accepted M1-01 implementation head:
  `56b4dfb5e4d4bef860616cde93d172affb0e4210`
- Accepted M1-02A+AR implementation head:
  `d82164c2f3be2164ad6e66b022f645be5f61844b`
- First M1-02B packet: returned at `a9af23a`; never implemented
- Replacement M1-02B: terminally returned after its sole targeted Decision
  Fidelity verification returned `REQUEST_CHANGES`; B1 is unauthorized

These facts support recovery only. They do not authorize dispatch or merge.

## Stopped worktree

The active correction worktree is
`/home/jeremy/Development/Maestro-m1-packets`. Preserve its uncommitted changes
to:

- `docs/planning/contracts/m1-02b-contract.json`
- `docs/planning/packets/m1-02-operational-state-and-recovery-primitives.md`

These files are failed-attempt evidence only. Their SHA-256 values are
`76303cbdf967a1acae1997a0473d267956ef53adac6616f35f3e485c2ef43e47` and
`92ddb1e1296c65c10e4826b603bd9dafcc136c868f3df3f2e26ecf8d60449c99`,
respectively. Do not merge, approve, discard, or reuse them as authority. No
M1 correction worker is running.

## Completed governance repair

The [Bootstrap Convergence Policy](../../docs/planning/bootstrap-convergence-policy.md)
received independent full review, one bounded three-finding correction set, and
targeted independent `APPROVE` at exact candidate head
`ea7483ab3963e8b465e3533ab0dd9d09f6adde3c`. PR #16 merged to `master`
at `a8f389682c98500981cd828a2028ec56b5782705`.

M1-02B remains frozen. The governance merge did not edit or dispatch it.

## Terminal M1-02B result

The reviewed base and current branch head were both
`ab271ffea42204c44c1894d53ba10e0d5f34ca4f`; no committed correction range or
staged candidate existed. The sole targeted Decision Fidelity verification
returned `REQUEST_CHANGES`. `MB-SLICE-M1-02B-REPLACEMENT-01` is terminally
`returned`, cannot be reopened or replaced, and cannot authorize B1.

## Completed review-readiness slice

`MB-SLICE-REVIEW-READINESS-GATE-01` completed at independently reviewed head
`5b01acb00e9890beb5a04f0bc483133e73129a08` and merged through PR #19 at
`6d5c2722380b99db0fb6f829f0afe073a1d49b80`. Decision Fidelity and
implementation review each used one correction and received targeted
`APPROVE`; focused tests passed 27/27 and the explicit regression suite passed
101/101.

## Next authorized action

The Project Architect may select the smallest executable post-readiness behavior
from the approved roadmap. Before any correction dispatch, it must disposition
review findings by real operating likelihood, consequence, reach, recovery, and
fix risk. A working candidate may be
`accepted-with-known-limitations` with a linked backlog issue; unchanged code
consumes no correction and needs no targeted implementation verification.
Critical exceptions and primary-outcome failures remain non-deferrable.

This governance direction does not itself authorize implementation, reopen
M1-02B, or alter the completed review-readiness slice.

### Frozen M1-02B slice identity and counters

- **Slice ID:** `MB-SLICE-M1-02B-REPLACEMENT-01`
- **Earlier first M1-02B packet:** terminal `returned` history at `a9af23a`;
  it is not this slice and creates no reusable allowance.
- **Replacement contract head reviewed:** `ab271ffea42204c44c1894d53ba10e0d5f34ca4f`
- **Complete Decision Fidelity review:** 1, consumed
- **Planning correction:** 1 authorized and interrupted; allowance consumed
- **Targeted planning verification:** 1, consumed; `REQUEST_CHANGES`
- **Implementation review:** 0, unused
- **Implementation correction:** 0, unused
- **Correction head:** none; branch HEAD remained equal to reviewed base
- **Terminal state:** `returned`
