# Maestro Repository Handoff

## Start here

- [Repository working rules](../../AGENTS.md) and [additional agent instructions](../../CLAUDE.md).
- [Project overview](../../docs/maestro-project-overview.md) — authoritative source entry and current-state evidence.
- [Architecture](../../docs/maestro-architecture.md) — system behavior and remaining mechanisms.
- [CLI declaration](../../docs/maestro-cli-project-milestones.md) and [registration declaration](../../docs/maestro-registration-project-milestones.md).
- [Planning Guide and templates](../../docs/planning-guide/README.md).
- [Maestro Project Architect — Software Architecture Role](../../docs/agents/architecture-agent.md).
- [Independent Fidelity Reviewer](../../docs/agents/decision-fidelity-reviewer.md).

## Where the discussion paused

The discussion reached the [Model Execution Adapter's internal responsibilities and shared operations](../../docs/maestro-architecture.md#model-execution-adapters).

The first agent integration to design is the Maestro Project Architect performing registration: assessing sources and preparing the candidate package. Agent software and model have not been chosen. Codex CLI was suggested but was not selected. Do not substitute an implementation worker as the first integration.

Continue with the concrete adapter connection for that registration assignment: tool selection, launch configuration, working area and artifact transport, run tracking, cancellation, and interruption recovery. Keep tool choice separate from the architect role and its authority.

## Decisions to preserve

- The architect is a software architecture role responsible for technical coherence and usable connected outcomes. It both assesses sources and prepares the candidate package.
- Routine technical choices within scope do not need Owner approval. Changed outcomes, expanded scope, conflicts with agreed requirements, reserved decisions, and final registration confirmation retain their agreed authority boundaries.
- The independent reviewer checks both assessment and candidate fidelity. Routine corrections go to the architect; justified material disagreement at the review limit reaches the Owner. No extra review loop was added.
- Role inputs and the [structured registration response](../../docs/maestro-architecture.md#registration-agent-response-contract) are already defined. Do not reopen them as unanswered questions.
- The adapter runs an agent tool; the service owns validation, durable records, budgets, question routing, and registration state. One adapter may run different roles in separate independent runs.
- For later execution work packets, the agent returns its implementation plan after reading the packet and then continues. Maestro records and displays it. No plan-review, approval, or pause gate is included now; such a gate is only a possible future addition.
- CLI implementation precedes registration development. Final connected CLI acceptance uses real initial registration integration. Re-registration display evidence belongs to REG-PM2 — Update a registration without losing approved history.
- Initial delivery remains CLI-only; the command center is excluded.

## Remaining design

Adapter-specific mechanics, registration package schema and locations, SQL/GitHub consistency, work-state enforcement, agent/publication recovery checkpoints, delivery-review authority, and review configuration remain to be defined. Routine technical settings can be resolved by the architect within the agreed scope.

The current documents specify outcomes and behavior, not implementation completion. Existing code is assessed during relevant development preparation; registration only checks claimed dependencies as needed.

## Working rules

Commit authorized changes directly to `master`; no branches or pull requests. Use plain, concise wording and include subjects with coded references. Architecture explains behavior; declarations explain delivery outcomes. Keep each fact authoritative in one place and use references elsewhere.

Apply review corrections to the main documents. Do not create or present separate review reports unless requested. Resume from the current documents and this handoff, without reopening settled decisions.
